# Given coordinates and a chromosome, write a program 
# for looking up it's annotation.  Keep in mind you'll 
# be doing this annotation millions of times.
# - Input: 
# 	- Tab-delimited file: Chr<tab>Position
# 	- GTF formatted file with genome annotations.
# - Output: 
# 	- Annotated file of gene name that input position overlaps.
# - Hint: Most of these reads come from a small portion 
# of the genome. Try to use this information to improve 
# performance, if possible.
